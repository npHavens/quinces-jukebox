## Usage

The JukeBox App allows a user to do the following:
- Search for songs & add songs to playlist
- Add a new user
- Upvote and downvote songs
- Play a song

### Search for songs & add songs to playlist
A user can go to the search page via the navigation menu. Once there, a user can type a song name in the input box and click the search button to see results. The user can select a song from the search results to add to the playlist.

If no username is selected when adding the song, the username associated with the added song will be `anonymous`

### Add a new user

To add a new user, go to the signup page via the navigation menu. Once added, the username should appear in the dropdown menu in the search page.

### Upvote and downvote songs
To upvote and downvote songs, click the correct buttons associated with each song on the playlist page. Songs are sorted based on their net vote count. A user can upvote or downvote a song more than once.

### Play a song
In order to play a song, the user must be logged in as host. To read more about this, please see [Placeholder]. Once logged in as host, the user should be able to see a button that says __Play top song__. If clicked, the top voted song will be sent to the player and that song will be removed from the playlist
